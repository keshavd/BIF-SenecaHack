##Mass Spectrum to Protein

Protein Mass spectrometry is application of mass spectrometry to proteins. Mass spectrometry is a technique that sorts ions according to their mass and gives exact chemical composition of a sample. Mass spectrum is a plot representing an intensity vs mass to charge ratio (m/z). Peaks found on a protein mass spectrum can be used to identify aminoacid residues present. This challenge focusses on obtaining information (structure, chemical composition) of a protein by utilizing mass spectrum given by designing a computational tool. You can use following mass spectrum data from a to C to develop your tool and identify the given examples.
